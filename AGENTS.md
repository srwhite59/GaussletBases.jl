# Agent Notes

These repo-local instructions are meant to reduce friction and keep future
agent work aligned with the current engineering contract.

## Julia execution

Prefer one of these two launch styles for routine work:

- plain `julia --project=. ...`
- `/Users/srw/Dropbox/codexhome/cjulia ...`

`cjulia` is preferred when you want one stable launcher path. It already:

- finds the repo root
- runs with `--project=<repo-root>`
- prefers the normal user Julia setup
- does **not** force a Dropbox-local depot unless explicitly requested

Do **not** use routine commands of the form:

- `env JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=... julia ...`

unless there is a specific reason that has already been justified.

In particular:

- do **not** use Dropbox-local Julia depots for normal runs
- prefer the normal user depot in `~/.julia` / `~/.juliaup`
- prefer checked-in or `tmp/work/*.jl` scripts over long inline `julia -e '...'`
  commands

Reason:

- `env ... julia ...` causes unnecessary permission friction in this
  environment
- Dropbox-local depots have previously caused operational problems

## Julia style

Use `JuliaStyle.md` as the local guide for small Julia cleanup passes and new
code edits. These preferences are low priority relative to correctness and
contract clarity; do not churn numerical kernels solely for style.

## Final-basis overlap policy

For final working bases that are intended to be orthonormal:

- self-overlaps `S_AA` and `S_BB` are diagnostic/debug objects only
- do **not** use them as normal downstream working data
- do **not** build generalized-overlap transfer logic on the final working-basis
  path

Normal final-basis transfer should use only the cross overlap:

- `S_BA = <B|A>`
- transfer with `C_B = S_BA * C_A`

Use self-overlaps only for:

- construction checks
- assertions
- difficult bug diagnostics
- or one final cleanup step if orthonormality is not yet good enough

- `DESIGN.md`

## Code cleanup policy

When a contract changes:

- do not only patch the main implementation
- also remove or simplify stale helpers, diagnostics, benchmarks, and docstrings
  that still encode the old idea

Two different costs matter:

- code volume
- conceptual drift

Conceptual drift is worse.

Small code that preserves a wrong contract is more dangerous than large code
that is conceptually clean.

Default rule:

- if a path is no longer part of the intended contract, delete it or quarantine
  it clearly as debug/reference-only

- `docs/code_bloat_and_wrong_contract_cleanup_note.md`

## Basis bundle policy

It is acceptable for a basis bundle to carry:

- basis-defining core data
- optional basis-attached helpful sidecars

Examples of acceptable sidecars:

- factorized parent structure
- shell/block grouping
- cached axis tables
- ordering/permutation metadata

But those sidecars must remain:

- clearly auxiliary
- reproducible from the basis construction
- not confused with the basis definition itself

## Calculation and analysis preferences

For nontrivial calculations, benchmarks, transfer studies, and solver runs:

- keep coarse `TimeG` timing enabled by default
- do **not** turn coarse timing off for expensive runs unless there is a
  specific reason
- save at least a coarse timing record as a durable artifact when practical

The minimum coarse timing summary should prefer user-facing phase labels such
as:

- build nested basis
- assemble operators / Hamiltonian
- transfer orbitals or states
- Hartree-Fock / SCF solve
- total

Do not rely only on terminal scrollback for timing. If a run matters, preserve
the coarse timing summary in a file, note, or other durable artifact.

## Performance review policy

Performance is part of correctness for public APIs, algorithmic routes, and
advertised reference utilities. A change is not fully validated until CPU time
and allocation behavior have been checked against a reasonable scale model.

For nontrivial coding work, do not jump directly from "what result is needed"
to "smallest patch that passes a test." First do a short design pass that:

- defines the computation, operator, or data transform being implemented
- identifies likely cost centers and expected scaling
- decides what should be tabulated, cached, reused, or contracted early
- checks whether existing kernels or contracts should be reused
- chooses an implementation seam that is reviewable and not needlessly
  duplicated

For performance-sensitive changes, reports and handoffs should include:

- computation definition and performance/organization strategy
- performance category: production route, reference-only but usable, or
  diagnostic/prototype
- expected CPU and memory scaling
- representative fixture size
- measured time and allocations or memory footprint
- durable timing/allocation artifact path when practical
- explicit decision: ready, needs optimization, or prototype-only

Do not call a public feature ready based only on tiny correctness tests. If
performance was not measured, say that explicitly and treat it as remaining
validation work.

## Result-reporting language

When reporting calculation or analysis results back to the user:

- prefer user-facing language over internal implementation language
- check labels and summaries for repo-internal shorthand before sending them
- if a new term is necessary, define it briefly the first time it appears
- if an internal code label is not directly meaningful to the user, translate it
  into a plain-language description

Default rule:

- summaries should be understandable without requiring the user to know repo
  internals, Julia helper names, or private shorthand
