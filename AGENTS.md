# Agent Notes

These repo-local instructions are meant to reduce friction and keep future
agent work aligned with the current engineering contract.

## Julia execution

Prefer one of these two launch styles for routine work:

- plain `julia --project=. ...`
- `/Users/srw/Dropbox/codexhome/cjulia ...`

`cjulia` is preferred when you want one stable launcher path. It already:

- finds the repo root
- runs with `--project=<repo-root>`
- prefers the normal user Julia setup
- does **not** force a Dropbox-local depot unless explicitly requested

Do **not** use routine commands of the form:

- `env JULIA_DEPOT_PATH=... julia ...`

unless there is a specific reason that has already been justified.

In particular:

- do **not** use Dropbox-local Julia depots for normal runs
- prefer the normal user depot in `~/.julia` / `~/.juliaup`
- prefer checked-in or `tmp/work/*.jl` scripts over long inline `julia -e '...'`
  commands

Reason:

- `env ... julia ...` causes unnecessary permission friction in this
  environment
- Dropbox-local depots have previously caused operational problems

## Final-basis overlap policy

For final working bases that are intended to be orthonormal:

- self-overlaps `S_AA` and `S_BB` are diagnostic/debug objects only
- do **not** use them as normal downstream working data
- do **not** build generalized-overlap transfer logic on the final working-basis
  path

Normal final-basis transfer should use only the cross overlap:

- `S_BA = <B|A>`
- transfer with `C_B = S_BA * C_A`

Use self-overlaps only for:

- construction checks
- assertions
- difficult bug diagnostics
- or one final cleanup step if orthonormality is not yet good enough

- `DESIGN.md`

## Code cleanup policy

When a contract changes:

- do not only patch the main implementation
- also remove or simplify stale helpers, diagnostics, benchmarks, and docstrings
  that still encode the old idea

Two different costs matter:

- code volume
- conceptual drift

Conceptual drift is worse.

Small code that preserves a wrong contract is more dangerous than large code
that is conceptually clean.

Default rule:

- if a path is no longer part of the intended contract, delete it or quarantine
  it clearly as debug/reference-only

- `docs/code_bloat_and_wrong_contract_cleanup_note.md`

## Basis bundle policy

It is acceptable for a basis bundle to carry:

- basis-defining core data
- optional basis-attached helpful sidecars

Examples of acceptable sidecars:

- factorized parent structure
- shell/block grouping
- cached axis tables
- ordering/permutation metadata

But those sidecars must remain:

- clearly auxiliary
- reproducible from the basis construction
- not confused with the basis definition itself
